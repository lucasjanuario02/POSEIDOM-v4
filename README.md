## Description:
POSEIDOM v4 is a diamond tokenization platform based on the Iron Bear v3 blockchain. This application allows the creation, transfer, and verification of ownership of tokens that represent diamonds on the Iron Bear network. In addition to these functionalities, POSEIDOM v4 now integrates Trident and Rubyx, enhancing its capabilities.

## Key Features:
- Creation of diamond tokens on the Iron Bear blockchain.
- Transfer of tokens between accounts.
- Verification of token ownership.
- Integration of Trident: ML, DL, and blockchain functionalities.
- Incorporation of Rubyx for quantum computing and hybrid digital asset creation.

## Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Iron Bear client configured and synchronized with the Iron Bear network.
- Basic knowledge of Solidity for Iron Bear smart contracts.
- Internet connection to interact with the Iron Bear network.

## Usage Instructions:

1. **Cloning the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/POSEIDOM-v4.git
   ```

2. **Installing Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd poseidom-v4
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuring the Iron Bear Network:**
   - Ensure your Iron Bear client is running and synchronized.
   - Configure the environment variables in the `.env` file with your Iron Bear network details.

4. **Deploying the Smart Contract:**
   - Compile and deploy the `DiamondToken.sol` smart contract on your Iron Bear network.
   - After deployment, update the contract address in the `config.js` file.

5. **Running the Application:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

6. **Interacting with POSEIDOM:**
   - Use the REST API endpoints to create, transfer, and verify diamond tokens.
   - Diamond tokens are represented as ERC-20 assets on the Iron Bear blockchain.

## Trident Integration:

Trident brings the power of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and blockchain to POSEIDOM v4. Explore advanced functionalities for security, transparency, and computational efficiency.

## Rubyx Integration:

Rubyx enables quantum computing and hybrid digital asset creation within POSEIDOM v4. Dive into the future of technology with quantum-powered solutions.

## Horigami FX Engine Integration
